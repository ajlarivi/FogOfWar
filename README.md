prototype campaign map for warhammer 40k killteam

## About
This is currently just a proof of concept + some fooling around with pygame. 
The end goal is to have a basic way of tracking a warhammer 40k campaign map, with key features being showing who controls what, resource tracking for each player, and persisting data even after the program is closed.
